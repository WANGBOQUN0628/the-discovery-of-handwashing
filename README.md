# the-discovery-of-handwashing
This is a project on [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com/)

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.
